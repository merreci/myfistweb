  <h2>State your purpose</h2>
<br/>If you are starting the email communication, it may be impossible to include a line of thanks.
<br/>Instead, begin by stating your purpose. For example, <b>"I am writing to enquire about ..."</b>
<br/>or <b>"I am writing in reference to ..."</b>".Make your purpose clear early on in the email,
<br/>and then move into the main text of your email. Remember, people want to read emails quickly,
<br/>so keep your sentences short and clear. You'll also need to pay careful attention to grammar,
<br/>spelling and punctuation so that you present a professional image of yourself and your company
