  <h2>Begin with a gretting</h2>
<br/>Always open your email with a gretting,such as <b>"Dear Lillian"</b>. If your relationship whith the reader is
<br/>formal,use their family name (eg. <b>"Dear Mrs. Price"</b>). If the relationship is more casual, you can simply say,
<br/> <b>"Hi Kelly"</b>. If you don't know the name of the person you are writing to, use:<b> "To whom it
<br/> may concern"</b> or <b>"Dear Sir/Madam"</b>.
