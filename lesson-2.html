  <h2>Thank the recipient</h2>
<br/>If you are replying to a client's inquiry, you should begin with a line of thanks.
<br/>For example, if someone has a question about your company, you can say,
<br/><b>"Thank you for contacting ABC Company"</b>. If someone has replied to one of your emails,
<br/>be sure to say, <b>"Thank you for your prompt reply"</b> or <b>"Thanks for getting back to me"</b>.
<br/>Thanking the reader puts him or her at ease, and it will make you appear more polite.
